# Prettifier

> A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that prettifies code in pull requests

## Notes

It currently only prettifies JavaScript files! Hopefully it will support more languages soon :)

## Setup

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the bot
npm start
```

## Contributing
